Declearing variables
    "var" decleares a variable globally
    "let" decleares a variable without having problems related with var
    "const" mostly we use const (95%).Value is not changeable

Printing variables
    "alert();"
    "document.write();"
    "console.log();"  mostly we use console.log().


Conditions testing
    if, else if, else:
        "if(Conditions){
            code to execute if this condition is true;
        }"
        
        "else if(Conditions){
            code to execute if this condition is true;
        }"
        "else{
            code to execute if this condition is false;
        }"
    
    Conditionals/ Ternary operator:
        "(Condition ? true : false);"    
    
    Switch statement:
        "switch( var/const/let ){
            case condition:
                code to execute if this case is true;
                break;
            case condition:
                code to execute if this case is true;
                break;
            default:
                code to execute if all cases are false;
        }"



Template Literals:
    const firstName = "Aimal";
    const lastName = "Khan";

    console.log(`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}`); //" ` " This is backtick.
    // Hello Aimal Khan
        is equvalent to -> console.log("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName);



Loops / Iterations:
    we should use "let" to decleares a variable for incrementation/decrementation.
    for:
        "for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
            code to execute;
        }"
    
    while:
        "while(condition){
            code to execute;
        }"

    do while:
        "do{
            code to execute;
        }while(condition);"


Objects:
    Objects are actually a variable that holds different types of data at a time.
    Objects are used to store data in a structured way.
    Objects can be nested inside other objects.
    Mostly data from server is in the form of array of objects.
    "let/const/var" can be used to decleare an object.
    
    "const objectName = {
        key: value,
        key: value,
        key: value,
        key: {          // Object inside an object. Nested object.
            key: value,
            key: value,
            key: value,
        },
    };"

                "property" is the name of the property.
                    We should use camel case instead of using hyphen.
                        eg: "fontSize" instead of "font-size".
                            "backgroundColor" instead of "background-color". etc
                "value" is the value of the property.

        "forms"
            Used to get or set the forms of an element.
            "document.forms["formname/id/etc"]["username/password/etc"].value"

        "elements"
            "creatElement()"
                Used to create an element.
                "document.createElement(tagName)"
                    "tagName" is the name of the tag.
                To give id we write:
                    "document.createElement(tagName).id = "id";
                To give value we can write:
                    "document.createElement(tagName).innerHTML = "value";

            "appendChild()"
                Used to add an element to the end of the parent element.
                "parent.appendChild(child)"
                    "parent" is the parent element (eg. document.body).
                    "child" is the child element.

            "insertBefore()"
                Used to add an element to the parent element before the reference element.

Asyncronous JS:
    The advantage of asynchronous programming is that the code is not executed in the same order as it is written.
    ""setTimeout()"  // same as "delay() in c++"
        Used to set a timer.
        "setTimeout(callBackFunction, time)"
            "callBackFunction" is the function to execute.
                When we pass a function as an argument, it is called a callback function.
            "time" is the time in milliseconds.
        But JavaScript will not wait for the timer to finish.It will execute the
        functions comming after that as soon as possible. It is the only behaviour of the javascript.
        javascript is not a multi threaded language. It is single threaded. Its behaviour by default is asynchronous.
        It means that the code will not wait for the timer to finish.

        Call Back Hell:
            When we have a lot of functions to execute, we can use call back hell.
            It is a chain of functions.
            its like this:
                "const one = () =>{
                    setTimeout ( (callback) => {
                        console.log("one");
                        callback();
                    }, timeInMilliseconds);
                }
                 const two = (callback) => {
                    setTimeout (()=>{
                        console.log("two");
                        callback();
                    }, timeInMilliseconds);
                }
                 const three = (callback) => {
                    setTimeout (()=>{
                        console.log("three");
                        callback();
                    }, timeInMilliseconds);
                }
                one(()=>{
                        two(()=>{
                                three(()=>{
                                        //do something
                                    }
                                )
                            }
                        )
                    }
                );"
                instead of this:
                    one ();
                    two ();
                    three ();
        
      
        Promises:
            A promise is new feature of ES6, a class that represents the result of an asynchronous
            operation.
            It is used to handle the asynchronous behaviour of the code.
            we can use library named 
            syntax is:
                "new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    //code
                })"
                It has two arguments:
                    "resolve" is the function to execute if the operation is successful.
                    "reject" is the function to execute if the operation fails.
            
            The above example is written as:
                "
                //How To Write:
                    const func1 = () => {
                        return new promise((resolve, reject)=>{
                            setTimeout(() => {
                                //code;
                                resolve();
                            }, timeInMilliseconds) 
                        })
                    }
                    const func2 = () => {
                        return new promise((resolve, reject)=>{
                            setTimeout(() => {
                                //code;
                                resolve();
                            }, timeInMilliseconds);
                        })
                    }
                    const func3 = () => {
                        return new promise ((resolve, reject) => {
                            setTimeout(() => {
                                //code;
                                resolve();
                            }, timeInMilliseconds)
                        })
                    }
                //How To Call:
                    func1().then() => {
                        func2().then()=>{
                            func3().then()=>{
                                //do something;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                "

        Asynic Await:
            It is just a method for calling promises.
            syntax is:
                "async function(){
                    await func1();
                    await func2();
                    await funcN();
                }"
                
            In above example write promises as it is, but instead of calling them like the above callback
            hell or the small promises hell; we can use async await.
            "
            //How To call The Above Example:
                async function funcName(){
                    await func1();
                    await func2();
                    await func3();
